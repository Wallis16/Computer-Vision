## final_project

Here we have a frame divided into two parts. Left side is our entry and right side is the exit. Person get recognized by facial image using the face_recognition library.

Once we have finished the process we generate 3 txt files containing entry and exit time. We also have a file with the number of times that someone has confirmed entry and exit.

In case of someone is not in our dataset we can take a picture, save and add an ID to this person.

My webcam isn't good, so I have to decide to make an example using youtube video that has a resolution so much better than my poor camera.
